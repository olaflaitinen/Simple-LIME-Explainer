# Simple LIME Explainer for Logistic Regression on the Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates the use of [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to explain predictions made by a logistic regression model trained on the Iris dataset. The repository is structured following industry best practices, including thorough documentation, testing, and continuous integration.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Load the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.
- **Model Training:** Train a logistic regression classifier.
- **LIME Integration:** Use LIME to generate explanations for model predictions.
- **Testing:** Unit tests for model training and explanation generation.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for continuous integration.
- **Documentation:** Detailed installation and usage guides.

## Installation

Please refer to [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) for installation instructions.

## Usage

An example usage script is provided in [examples/run_explainer.py](examples/run_explainer.py). For further details, see [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).
